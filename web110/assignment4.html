<b>Activity: Complete the tutorial TutorialsPoint: Social Networking. Based on the information provided, decide which of the following social media sites interest you.</b><br>
I completed the offered tutorial, however, I found it to be rather outdated. It still had Google+ as a viable option, and that social network was closed in April of 2019. It also contained few social media websites and messengers I was unfamiliar with, like Faceparty and ibibo. Faceparty is UK-based, and it looks like ibibo is used predominantly in India, so I am not interested in exploring either.<br>
Social media sites that interest me (and were not on the tutorial’s list) are Instagram and Reddit.<br>
With this activity, I learned more about social media websites that exist out there, but I will not be using them in my personal or professional life.<br>
<br>
<b>Activity: Complete one or more of the following tutorials.</b><br>
I chose to review the tutorials for LinkedIn, Snapchat, and Pinterest.<br>
LinkedIn is used mostly for creating professional connections, Snapchat’s distinctive feature is that media you share disappears after some time, and Pinterest is used to put “pins” on things you like or create differently themed boards.
I use LinkedIn, but not the other two.<br>
This activity gave me an overview of social media platforms, but I am rather selective about which social media platforms I join, so I am not going to create Snapchat, Pinterest, Tumblr, or other social media accounts I see no value in. <br>
<br>
<b>Activity: Review Smart Insights: The Honeycomb model. Evaluate each of the most popular social media sites (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, Tumblr, Twitter, YouTube) based on their level of support for each of the honeycomb framework elements. </b><br>
Honeycomb model is a framework proposed by a group of professors from Canada. It proposes the idea that a social media platform can have 7 key elements, and companies can concentrate their branding and digital marketing efforts depending on what elements are the most relevant for them.<br>
The elements are: Identity, Sharing, Presence, Relationships, Reputation, Conversations, Groups. <br>

<br>
<i>Explanation:</i><br>
By creating this table, I attempted to analyze levels of support of honeycomb elements by some of the social media websites I am familiar with (I have never used Tumblr or Snapchat, so I wouldn’t know their strengths and weaknesses).<br>
 It’s all my personal opinion, and I might not be correct in every instance. The highlighted criteria are the ones that I consider the strongest for the respective platform - for example, I think that sharing is the strongest element of Instagram. <br> 
As we can see, Facebook appears to have all honeycomb framework elements, although I personally don’t use it.  I ranked YouTube “weak” in a lot of categories, but at the same time I don’t think their strong focus is on Presence or Relationships. <br>
<br>
With this activity, I learned about the interesting new concept of honeycomb framework. I was able to analyze various social media through the prism of the framework, and reflect on my personal social media usage. I use Instagram infrequently and Reddit (pretty heavily) in my personal life, and LinkedIn for work, and am not interested in adding any more social media to my life.<br>
<br>
<b>Activity: Research remote desktop applications and use one of the following programs to remotely connect to another computer.</b>
I reviewed the resource provided on Chrome Remote Desktop.<br>
Chrome Remote Desktop is a remote desktop tool developed by Google.<br>
To try the remote desktop tool, I went to <i>remotedesktop.google.com</i> web portal, and installed an extension called Chrome Remote Desktop. After that, I assigned a name and PIN to my computer. To be able to connect from my smartphone, I downloaded a mobile application also called Remote Desktop, and logged into the same Gmail account as on the laptop. There, I was able to see my computer, and establish a remote connection after providing the PIN created earlier. I was able to browse my computer from my phone and was very surprised at how easy the setup was in general.<br>

I also was curious to see what the traffic looks like, so started Wireshark traffic capture. I forgot that Remote Desktop Protocol is Windows-only protocol and expected to see it, but obviously did not. The protocol I saw in use was STUN, Session Traversal Utilities for NAT. It is a tool for communications protocols to cross network address translators that sit in between two endpoints of communication.<br>

<br>
With this activity, I was able to successfully establish a remote connection between my personal computer and my phone. I will leave the extension on my laptop and the application on my phone, and use this knowledge to use the remote desktop connection when I need it for my schoolwork or in personal life, I wouldn’t install this remote desktop tool on my work computer to avoid any security-related issues.<br>
