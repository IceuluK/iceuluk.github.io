    <b>Activity: Learning about Project Management, coming up with the idea and plan for the Final Project, creating a Gantt chart</b><br>
For the final project, I decided to create a presentation on Security.<br>
Although a lot of other topics of the class were interesting to me (e.g. HTML, Networking, Javascript), I feel like I could speak more confidently and passionately about Security. <br>
Some concepts I would like to cover in the presenation: what is cybersecurity, common terms, importance of strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, tips on web safety.<br>
<br>
In this Session, we started learning about Project Management.<br>
It is an important discipline that is crucial to understand, since projects need to be managed and executed to success each day in every business, big or small.<br>
Traditionally, project management includes following or groups of processes:<br>
1. Initiation <br>
2. Planning <br>
3. Execution <br>
4. Monitoring and controlling <br>
5. Closing <br>
<br>
