    <b>Activity: Creating a table of contents</b><br>
    In this session, I learned more about HTML, and was able to apply the new knowldegde in practice.<br>
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the standard markup language for web documents. It can be assisted by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and Javascript, but I haven't had a chance to explore those yet. <br>
    So far in this course, I learned what a typical HTML document contains, how to make text <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <u>underlined</u>, how to break to a new line, how to insert pictures, and now - how to insert reference links in an HTMl page.<br>
    For Assignment 7, I created an unordered list with links to previous assignments in this class. <br>
    This and previous knowledge about HTML received during this course will help me: <br>
    1) in my personal life - I am thinking of starting an online blog in the future, and knowldegde of HTML would be useful for creating/editing web pages; <br>
    2) in my professional life - an IT professional (especially in cybersecurity) needs to know basics of HTML and CSS, to be able to examine the code in Developer tools in a browser. <br>
