    <b>Activity: Learning and practicing CSS</b><br>
    In this session, we learned about Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to describe how elements are presented in a document written in a markup language like HTML. <br>
    I learned about concepts of external CSS (can change style of an entire website), internal CSS (change style of one page), and inline CSS (to change style of one element). I practiced applying those styles to the web pages containing my assignments. <br>
    I also learned how to change background color, text color, margins, font type and size. <br>
    At one point I was confused because even after saving changes in Github and refreshing web pages, CSS changes were not being applied, but then I tried one of the pages in Inocgnito mode of Chrome browser, and saw the changes. Turns out, the Google Chrome cache was the (minor) problem in this case, so I cleared it. <br>
    All this knowledge will be helpful:<br>
    1) in my personal life - if/when I get to creating a blog, I could control the appearance of it myself;<br>
    2) in my professional life - I need to be able to read CSS to examine web pages.  <br>
    I am looking forward to practice CSS and HTML more.<br>
