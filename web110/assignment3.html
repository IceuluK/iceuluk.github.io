<b>Activity: Complete the following tutorials:</b><br>
 - GCF Global: Email Basics<br>
 - TutorialsPoint: E-mail Overview<br>
I completed the offered tutorials.<br>
Email – electronic mail – is used to send and receive messages over Internet. To receive emails, you need an email address, and to send emails, you need to know email addresses of other people. Email addresses are written in standard format – local-part@domain, for example, aisuluu@gmail.com.<br>
There are different email providers that provide free web-based email services, top three are Gmail (Google), Yahoo, and MS Outlook (Microsoft). Companies, organizations, schools host their domain and provide their own domains ending with gov., org., edu.<br>
Nowadays, webmail providers also offer various productivity features, so it’s easier to stay organized, like: online address book, integration with calendar, instant messaging. <br>
I personally find very convenient that with both those providers, when I reply “yes” to a meeting in an email, it automatically is added to my calendar. <br>
Tutorials also covered useful topics like email etiquette and tips on avoiding email scams.<br>
After finishing the tutorial, I completed the quiz on basics of email knowledge:<br>

<i>New concepts learned:</i><br>
Since I use email every day, I was familiar with a lot of material in the tutorials, but I never knew about keyboard shortcuts you could use.<br>
I learned that if you press “?” while in Gmail, a list with shortcuts will pop up (and which ones are currently enabled) Some of the shortcuts I memorized so far:<br>
Shift + r – reply in a new window<br>
* then a – select all conversations<br>
! – report as Spam<br>
Shift + I  -mark as Read<br>
<br>
Some shortcuts I learned I could use in Outlook:
Ctrl + Shift + M - create a new message.
Ctrl + 2 – go to Calendar
Alt + H – open the Home tab
This knowledge will help me to be more efficient when using Gmail in personal life and at school, and MS Outlook at work. 


Activity: View email message headers.
I reviewed the offered resources on email spoofing and email message headers.
Email contains three parts: the envelope, the header, and the body. The envelope is the information that the email program and a server use to communicate, and neither sender nor recipient can see it. Email header is the part that precedes the body (the main text, the actual message). Email headers contain technical details like From, To, Date, Subject, Return Path, Received, Content-type. As we see, a lot of information can be extracted from an email header. 
Email spoofing occurs when someone sends you an email with a forged sender address. The tactic is usually used in phishing and email scams.
To see the email header of one of the emails I received today, I opened that email in Gmail, found “More “ three-dot icon, and chose “Show original” option. 
I copied the text and used the Message Header Tool and reviewed the results.


New concepts learned: email headers, how to see enail headers in Gmail and MS Outlook, Sender Policy Framework (SPF, email authentication technique that helps from spam and spoofing), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Service (allows the sender to electronically sign legitimate emails).
Looking into email headers and identifying if an email is potentially spoofed is a part of cybersecurity professional’s job. Usually an automated tool is used to pick up on suspicious email headers, but sometimes an analyst needs to review them manually. This knowledge about email headers and how to read them will help me in day-to-day operations when I step into a full-time job.
