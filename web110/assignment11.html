    <h1>Assignment 11</h1>
    <p>
    <h2>PART 1: Project Management</h2>
    <b>Activity: Learning about Project Management, coming up with the idea and plan for the Final Project, creating a Gantt chart</b><br>
For the final project, I decided to create a presentation on Security.<br>
Although a lot of other topics of the class were interesting to me (e.g. HTML, Networking, Javascript), I feel like I could speak more confidently and passionately about Security. <br>
Some concepts I would like to cover in the presenation: what is cybersecurity, common terms, importance of strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, tips on web safety.<br>
<br>
In this Session, we started learning about Project Management.<br>
It is an important discipline that is crucial to understand, since projects need to be managed and executed to success each day in every business, big or small.<br>
Traditionally, project management includes following or groups of processes:<br>
1. Initiation <br>
2. Planning <br>
3. Execution <br>
4. Monitoring and controlling <br>
5. Closing <br>
<br>

<i>Project Scope:</i>PowerPoint presentation including 10-12 slides on the topic, designed by and narrated by the presenter (Aisuluu)<br>
<i>Project Purpose:</i>to demonstrate that I understood the concept I am presenting on, after completing the corresponding session of WEB110 class; to provide useful information to classmates; to receive B or A grade for the final project<br>

<h2>PART 2: IT Careers</h2>
<b> Activity: Complete the tutorial "GCFLearnFree: Career Planning and Salary". Then download and fill out the "GCFLearnFree: Career Planning Worksheet".</b><br>
I completed the tutorial and took the corresponding quiz. The tutorial contained useful tips on exploring different careers, basics of salary research, strategies on creating a strong career plan.<br>
The topic I found the most interesting was setting S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Timely, Relevant) goals.<br>
As part of the activity, I filled out the worksheet:<br>

<br>
<b>Activity: Review IT Career Finder: IT Certfications. Research preparation requirements and current salary ranges for certifications that interest you. </b><br>
After reviewing the resource and researching various IT certifications, I created a table of 3 certifications I would like to get (Security+ - this year, and the other two in the future, after obtaining the required work experience): <br>

<br>
The activities gave me a better outlook of available IT careers and paths. <br>
The knowledge gained during this session will help me in my professional life since I am only starting my career and it is important for me to know how to plan my career and make sure my salary is competitive.<br>
