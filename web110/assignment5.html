        <h1>Activity: Verify Internet connectivity.</h1>
<p>
  •	Verify a physical connection.<br>
I have a wireless connection on my personal laptop that I use for schoolwork. To verify Internet connectivity, I located and clicked the Wi-Fi icon in the right lower corner on the Taskbar. I verified that there was “Connected, secured” note below my home network’s SSID (Service Set IDentifier).<br>
I also went to Properties of this wireless connection, and reviewed details like: Protocol (Wi-Fi 4, 802.11n), Security type (WPA2-Personal), Network band (2.4GHz), IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, MAC address. <br>
<br>
  •	Verify IP address settings.<br>
To verify IP address settings, I opened Command Prompt and typed “ipconfig”. The output was “Windows IP configuration”  including basic configurations for all adapters (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, subnet mask, default gateway).<br>
To view the full configurations, I typed “ipconfig /all”. The output was more detailed information about my machine’s IP configuration, including details like Lease Obtained/Expires and DNS servers. <br>
(Only results for the wireless adapter shown below)<br>

<br>

  •	Review Ping/Host. Verify local and remote connectivity using ping.<br>
<i>Ping</i> is a useful utility that is used to test the reachability of a host on a network. <br>
Ping sends an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request messages and waits for a return message. By default ping sends 4 requests; after the response, one can see bytes sent and received and packets sent, received/lost.<br> 
Ping can be used to troubleshoot network connectivity by reviewing potential packet loss on the way.<br> 
To practice using it, I pinged my local IP address and my default gateway address (both were looked up in ipconfig details in the previous activity), then pinged 8.8.8.8 (Google).<br>

<br>
  •	Review Tracert. Trace the route to an Internet host such as 8.8.8.8.<br>
<i>traceroute</i> command (in Windows – tracert) helps to trace the paths that network packets take.<br>
Traceroute sends ICMP packets to the destination, with different time-to-live (TTL) values. Each time a packet is handed over to the next router, the TTL is decreased by 1. When TTL reaches 0, the packet is discarded and the router returns “Time Exceeded” message. Traceroute sends the first packet with a TTL of 1 and increases the TTL by 1 on each following packet, until the destination responds or until the maximum TTL is reached. This way, we can see where the traffic has problems on the network (abnormal latencies or stops).<br>
To practice using traceroute, I opened the Command Prompt, then typed “tracert 8.8.8.8”<br>
The result was:<br>
<i>Tracing route to dns.google [8.8.8.8]<br>
over a maximum of 30 hops:</i><br>
It took 14 hope to get to the destination.<br>

This way, I could see the route packets took from my computer to 8.8.8.8 <br>
<br>
  •	Review Nslookup. Verify name resolution using nslookup and an Internet host name, such as en.wikiversity.org.<br>
<i>nslookup</i> is another useful tool used for querying the DNS (Domain Name System) servers to obtain the corresponding domain name and IP address.<br>
I used nslookup utility in Command Prompt to review host addresses and also using a custom DNS server, and reviewed the results:<br>

<b><i> With this activity, I learned about and practiced using some basic but important network administration utilities: ipconfig, ping, tracert, nslookup. All these will be used by me at work – for example, when I want to troubleshoot network connectivity, or map a domain name to an IP address. In personal life so far, I remember trying to use ipconfig /flushdns when having some DNS errors. </i></b><br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Activity: Research, identify and describe the necessary components required to set-up a home network for yourself.</b><br>
After reading a few resources on the Internet, I came to a conclusion that setting up a home network requires the following steps:<br>
1.	<u>Planning</u> – thinking about what will I need, should the network be wired or wireless, how many devices will I have on the network<br>
Wired connection (using Ethernet cables) is generally faster and beneficial if I would, for example, be heavily playing video games, but I use Internet to: connect remotely to work office, do the schoolwork, and to stream movies sometimes. I feel like these activities are not very demanding in terms of network usage.
I live in a rather small apartment, so don’t need to be concerned about Wi-Fi coverage, or getting few routers. <br>
I would have about 5-6 devices on the network, all connected wirelessly (personal laptop, work laptop, mobile phone, my kid’s iPad), besides maybe the TV which I would connect via cable.<br>
2.  <u>Choosing the equipment</u>– for a home network, I would need:<br>
- the modem, to give me access to Internet (usually supplied by Internet Service Provider). The modem can also be combined with a router into one device.<br>
- the router, to connect a modem to other devices on my network, and allow communication between those devices (that form a local area network) and the Internet. Nowadays, router usually incorporates Wireless Access Point to emits signals for wireless devices.<br>
- cables –to connect the router to the modem (for example, cat5e cable with RJ45 connectors can be used), and for wired connection(s).<br>
- devices that will be on the network - do they have wireless capability and/or ports for cables?<br>
3.	<u>Setting up the network</u><br>
- changing default parameters of the router (SSID, router admin password)<br>
- set up DHCP and DNS servers <br>
- configure firewall for security<br>
<br>
<b><i> With this activity, I was able to reflect on what components I would need for a small home network. The activity gave me a better understanding of networking concepts and network devices. I will use this knowledge in personal life – when I need to set up a home network after I move soon, and at work it is necessary for me to have foundational knowledge of what networks consist of.</i></b><br>
