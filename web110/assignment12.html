<p> Select all customers</p>
    <ul>
      <li> SELECT * FROM Customers; </li>
    </ul>
<p> Select customers from USA</p>
    <ul>
      <li> SELECT * FROM Customers<br>
        WHERE Country='USA';
      </li>
    </ul>
<p> Count number of products (count number or rows that match ProductID)</p>
    <ul>
      <li> SELECT COUNT(ProductID) <br>
        FROM Products;        
      </li>
    </ul>
<p> Insert a new record in the Customers table</p>
    <ul>
      <li> INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country) <br>
        VALUES ('AK Sweets','Aisuluu K','250 W Dundee Rd','Wheeling','60090','USA');       
      </li>
    </ul>
<p> Update the first customer's contact name and city in Customers table </p>
    <ul>
      <li> UPDATE Customers <br>
        SET ContactName='Hugo Stiglitz', City='Berlin' <br>
        WHERE CustomerID=1;
      </li>
    </ul>

With the activities of this session, I refreshed my memory of databases and basics of SQL (from the class I took in the past).<br>
I practiced basic SQL statements, and also learned 2 new I haven't tried before - INSERT and UPDATE. With UPDATE statements, I need to remember to be careful - I learned that if WHERE clause is omitted, all records in a given table will be updated.<br>
The knowledge gained during the session will help me in my professional life:<br>
- when I need to use SQL while working with databases of assets being scanned for vulnerabilities <br>
- when I need to dive deeper in learning SQL to be able to perform a SQL injection, a common web hacking technique.
