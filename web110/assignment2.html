      <b>Activity: Configure browser extensions and add-ons.</b><br>
      I reviewed the offered resources. To see what extensions were present in my Google Chrome browser, I opened it, clicked “Customize and control” three-dot icon in the upper-right corner, then navigated to “More tools” option in the menu, and selected “Extensions”.<br>
      Some of the extensions I had: uBlock Origin for ad blocker, Grammarly for grammar checking (disabled), Rakuten for cashback, DuckDuckGo extension for Google Chrome (disabled), Honey extension for finding deals and coupons. I disabled Honey by clicking the toggle switch so it changed from blue to grey, and enabled Grammarly in the same manner.<br>
      I searched Internet for the most popular add-ons for Google Chrome, and results included LastPass for password manager, Evernote Web Clipper for saving web pages, and Open Tab for combining many tabs in one. I installed Open Tab extension and now can join tabs related to different school classes in separate united tabs.<br>
      <i>With this activity, I expanded my knowledge on browser add-ons and discovered a few browser extensions that were new for me. The new extension I installed while completing the Lesson will help me be more organized and efficient when comlpleting the school work.</i><br>
      <br>
      <b>Activity: Compare browser HTML5 compatibility.</b><br>
      I reviewed the offered resource and learned that different bworsers have different HTML5 compatibility.
      The tool showed that Chrome 84 on Windows 10 has 98.5% HTML5 accessibility. In the second link, I clicked “your browser” tab to see how well my browser supports HTML5, and it scored 528 out of 555 points. For comparison, Edge browser showed to score 429 out of 555 points.<br>
      <i>With this activity, I learned how to check a browser's HTML5 compatibility. This knowledge will help me choose the best browser suited for my needs, both personal and at work.</i> <br>
      <br>
      <b>Activity: Compare search engines.</b><br>
      I searched for web search engine using Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask, and compared the results.<br>
      I thought Google had the best user interface because it is just the search bar, thus it looks clean, unlike Yahoo or Ask that had news and trending articles on the main page, I would find this distracting in every day use.<br>
      Top results of every search engine were:<br>
      Google – Wikipedia page for “Search engine”<br>
      Bing – Top 10 Search Engines In The World (2022 update), article from reliablesoft.net<br>
      Yahoo - 22 Alternative Search Engines to Use in 2022, article from kinsta.com<br>
      Ask - 20 Great Search Engines You Can Use Instead of Google, searchenginejournal.com<br>
      I thought Google and Yahoo had the best results because Yahoo had Wikipedia “Search engine” page as a separate table on the right. I think it's useful when the first search result is a Wikipedia page or some other source that you know will have citations<br>
      According to Statista.com, Google Chrome had the biggest market share among search engines (last data based on September 2021), with 86.64% of market share, Bing had 6.79%, Yahoo – 2.75%. As we see, Google dominates the market here.<br>
      <i>With this activity, I was able to compare various search engines and the results they produce. This knowledge helped me decide which search engine I prefer to use in personal and work life (I prefer continuing using Google).</i><br>
      <br>
      <b>Activity: Cite a web page.</b><br>
      I reviewed the Cite this page link and tried to cite a Wikiversity page from another class I am taking, Windows Server Administration/Installation. I also reviewed the Cite This Page for Internet Fundamentals/Search Engines.<br> 
      In both cases, pages contained bibliographic details like Page Name, Author, Publisher (Wikiversity), Date of last revision, Date retrieved, URL, Primary contributors, Page Version ID.<br>
      Different citation styles had different details included, for example:<br>
      <i>APA style:</i> Internet Fundamentals/Search Engines. (2021, November 18). Wikiversity. Retrieved 16:38, November 18, 2021 from [link to the page]<br>
      <i>Chicago style:</i> Wikiversity contributors, "Internet Fundamentals/Search Engines," Wikiversity, [link to the page] (accessed November 18, 2021).<br>
      <i>With this activity, I learned to cite a web page. I usually use APA citation style, as most professors require, but it was useful to see the other citation styles, and how they differ, in case I’ll have to use them for school work or at work.</i>
