    Summary:<br>
    With this activity, I explored different types of graphics and multimedia that can be embedded in an HTML page.<br>
    I learned to upload files using Visual Code Studio web editor, before this I would use interface in the GitHub repository itself.<br>
    <br>
    I've worked with vector images before - I used to do laser cutting, and would design the files to cut in CorelDraw. Since then, I like working with vector files because you can change a picture's size without loss of the resolution.<br>
    But for this activity I used a raster image, it has a size of 485x483 pixels.<br>
    I reviewed the types of audio and video files - some were familiar (.mp4, .mp3, .avi), and some types were new to me (.oga, .webm). <br>
    I learned different tags to insert multimedia and images; this knowledge will help me:<br>
    1) in my personal life - when I need to insert images and audio/video while creating personal web pages;<br>
    2) in my professional life - I need to be able to recognize various HTMl tags when inspecting web pages on the suspicion of a malicious code or script.<br>
